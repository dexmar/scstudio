# scstudio - Blender Import-Export for .scm and .sca file formats

## Project Continuity Notice

This project is an independent continuation and hard fork of the
[scstudio](https://github.com/Solstice245/scstudio) repository originally created by
**John Wharton** ([@Solstice245](https://github.com/Solstice245)).

This repository serves as the new home for updates, bug fixes, and compatibility patches for
newer Blender versions. All foundational credit goes to John Wharton for their incredible work
building this addon.

This project remains strictly licensed under the terms of the **GPL-2.0 License**.

### Blender compatibility

The addon manifest still declares a minimum of Blender 3.0, and the compatibility
shims are written to keep the older code paths working. However, **all testing for
this release was performed on Blender 5.1.1** — earlier versions are unverified.


__Blender__ addon to ___import and export___ 3D model/animation files used in the game __Supreme Commander__

Created by *John Wharton*

## Installation

1. Download the most recent version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dexmar/scstudio/releases) or clone this repository at __(https://github.com/dexmar/scstudio)__
2. Install the addon using one of these methods:
- __Option A__ (automatic):
    1. From the Blender menu, navigate to `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons`.
    2. Click on the _Install_ button and select the ___zipped___ folder containing the addon.
- __Option B__ (manual):
    1. Extract the files from the ___zipped___ folder to `scstudio` directory.
    2. Place the newly made folder into the following location (Adjust for the installed version of Blender):
        - `%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.0x\scripts\addons` _(Assumes a Windows operating system)_
    - _(If the addon does not appear as a choice in Blender's preferences click the `Refresh` button or restart the application.)_
3. Activate the addon in Blender's preferences by toggling the checkbox for the `Supreme Commander SCM & SCA format` entry in the Add-ons tab.

## Usage

The following operation is added to the _Import_ top bar:
- __Supreme Commander Model (.scm)__
    - Opens a file manager from which you can select _multiple_ files at a time.
    - Option: __Generate Materials__
        - If the file is being imported from the same directory as the blueprint and texture files, Blender will try to have material nodes set up to use those textures automatically.
    - For each file, an armature object and child mesh object are placed into the scene using data from the file.

The following operation is added to the _Export_ top bar:
- __Supreme Commander Model (.scm)__
    - Operates on all selected armature objects.
    - All mesh vertices must be rigged to their parent armature via vertex groups.
    - Opens a file manager from which you may select an output directory. The output file name is derived from the armature object's name.
    - The output data is derived from the armature object and all mesh objects which are parented under it.

The following panel is added to the _Data_ tab of the properties editor:
- __Supreme Commander Animations__
    - Operator: __Import (.sca)__
        - Opens a file manager from which you can select _multiple_ files at a time, and import the animation data into Blender. Once imported, the animation names are added to the animation list, and then assigned the action and custom frame range values.
    - UI List:
        - Lists all of the animations which have been imported onto the armature. Each entry has an action drop down and frame range values.
        - Selecting an animation in the list will automatically adjust the scene so that the armature is using the animation's action, and the timeline is using the animation's defined frame range.
        - To return to an unanimated state, right click an item in the list and select _"Reset to Default Value"_ from the dropdown.
        - Operator: __Export (.sca)__
            - Operates on the selected animation in the list.
            - Opens a file manager from which you may select an output directory. The output file name is derived from the name given to the animation entry in the list.
            - The output data is derived from the animation's selected action and frame range.
